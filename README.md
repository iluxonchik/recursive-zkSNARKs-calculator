This repository contains a recursive implementation of a calculator using recusrsive zkSNARKs. This Zero-Knowledge Application is implemented
using O1JS, which is the Zero-Knowledge circuit framework used to develop applications on the Mina Blockchain.

This is an accopanying resource my blog post titled "Recursive zkSNARK Proof as a Private Input - What Is Visible?". The blog post can be found at
